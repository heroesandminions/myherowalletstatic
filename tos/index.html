Any information provided by the User to MyHeroWallet that is inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete may result in the User’s Digital Assets becoming permanently lost.  MyHeroWallet shall not be held liable for any loss that occurs resulting from inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete information that the User provided for such transfers. MyHeroWallet shall have no liability for any information provided by the User for the transfer of Digital Assets to which MyHeroWallet is unable to process, resulting in a delay or failure of requested withdrawal.  All Eligible Digital Assets withdrawn from MyHeroWallet Account shall no longer generate Rewards.</p>
<p>If in any event that MyHeroWallet and/or any of its third-party partners experience technical or operational difficulties, cyber-attacks, or market volatility, which could result in a temporary or permanent suspension of deposits and/or withdrawals, MyHeroWallet shall not be held responsible or liable for any loss or damage incurred by the User as a result.  All withdrawal requests that are inaccurate, misleading, incomplete provided by the User, or suspicious of financial crime and money</p>
<p>Every withdrawal request shall be deemed pending until accepted by MyHeroWallet. MyHeroWallet may refuse to accept such request, or delay the processing of an approved request for any reasonable reason, including but not limited to insufficient Digital Assets in a User Account, inaccurate or misleading information provided by the User, or any doubt or suspicion of money laundering or other financial crime related to the User Account.</p>
<p>For every withdrawal request, you will be required to provide the details of the Virtual Wallet to which you wish to receive your repayment of Digital Assets. For the avoidance of doubt, any repayment shall be in-kind (i.e. in the same type of Eligible Digital Assets loaned by you, but not the actual same Digital Assets originally transferred by you).</p>
<p>In the event that the details you provide are inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading, your Digital Assets may be permanently lost. We will not be liable for any loss that results from inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading details that you may provide for such transfer. If the transfer address you specify is one to which we are unable to process transfers, we will have no liability for any resulting failure or delay in processing your requested withdrawal.</p>
<p>MyHeroWallet and our third-party partners may experience cyber-attacks, extreme market conditions, or other operational or technical difficulties which could result in the immediate halt of transactions either temporarily or permanently. Provided that MyHeroWallet has taken reasonable commercial and operational measures to prevent such events in technical systems controlled by MyHeroWallet, MyHeroWallet is not and will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred by you as a result of such cyber-attacks, operational or technical difficulties or suspensions of transactions. Withdrawal limits based on amounts and/or frequency may apply from time to time, based on legal, regulatory, AML, and/or security considerations. Our policies and procedures may require additional security and/or compliance checks that require additional time to complete. Any individual request to exceed withdrawal limits set by MyHeroWallet must be sent via email to <a href="mailto:hello@finbloxapp.com">hello@MyHeroWalletapp.com</a>.</p>
<p>Every transmission request shall be deemed pending until accepted by us. We may refuse to accept such request, or delay the processing of an approved request for any reasonable reason, including but not limited to inaccurate or misleading information provided by you, or any doubt or suspicion of fraud, misrepresentation, a sanctioned transaction, money laundering, terrorism financing or other financial crime related to your MyHeroWallet Account.</p>

<li><strong> Reward Earning Calculation</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>MyHeroWallet is able to calculate the Rewards on Loaned Digital Assets through analytical research on each Eligible Digital Asset in the market.  Rewards are paid out into your MyHeroWallet Account towards the principal loaned amount as part of the FinEarn Program which is reflected in your balance.  MyHeroWallet at its sole discretion may update rates from time to time. The rewards MyHeroWallet pays users for transferring their Digital Assets are determined based on a variety of considerations, including market conditions, demand, and supply of a particular Digital Assets are not determined based on MyHeroWallet income or profit generated. While MyHeroWallet strives to maintain stable reward rates over time, any change in circumstances may bring about changes to such rates. Users will be updated on any change to reward rates and may choose to discontinue using the ‘earn’ service at any time.  If, at any time, for legal or other reasons, a MyHeroWallet Account is suspended or frozen by MyHeroWallet, Loaned Digital Assets connected to such a MyHeroWallet Account shall not be eligible to earn Rewards.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li><strong> Consent to MyHeroWallet’s Use of Digital Assets</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>By registering for a MyHeroWallet Account, the use of the Services, and the deposit of Digital Assets to the Platform, you grant MyHeroWallet, subject to these Terms; applicable laws, and for the duration of the period to which the Eligible Digital Assets are Loaned to MyHeroWallet by you, all right and title to such Digital Assets, including ownership rights, and the right, without further notice to you, to hold such Digital Assets in MyHeroWallets own Virtual Wallet or elsewhere, for the use of lending, rehypothecation, pledging, or otherwise transferring to use any amount of such Digital Assets, separately or together, by MyHeroWallet to invest in MyHeroWallet full discretion. You shall agree and acknowledge with respect to the use of Digital Assets by MyHeroWallet pursuant to the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Digital Assets for lending or other transferring purposes by MyHeroWallet may receive compensation to which you have no claim or entitlement: and</li>
<li>Your rights of ownership cannot be exercised;</li>
<li>You may not have any legal remedies or rights in connection with MyHeroWallets obligations to you, and regain or recover ownership of such Digital Assets in the event that MyHeroWallet is unable to repay its obligations.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="15">
<li><strong> Hard Forks</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Any blockchain may undergo software updates from time to time, which will result in a permanent divergence in the blockchain (a “Hard Fork”). The result is that such a blockchain will split into two separate and distinct blockchains, and any Digital Asset on that original blockchain may entitle its holders to a new type of Digital Asset (the “New Currency”). Due to the administrative complexity of being the repository for a hard-forked Digital Asset, the support of any New Currency in a User Account is solely at the discretion of MyHeroWallet. Unless otherwise announced in writing by MyHeroWallet, MyHeroWallet will not support any New Currencies (“Unsupported Currencies”), in which case all User Accounts will be denominated in the legacy Digital Asset and all interest will accrue in the legacy Digital Asset. The User agrees that MyHeroWallet assumes no responsibility whatsoever with respect to those Unsupported Currencies and the User will not be able to recover the Unsupported Currencies from MyHeroWallet.</p>
<p>In the event of a Hard Fork or other network disruption, MyHeroWallet may not be able to support activity related to your Digital Asset, and; the transactions may not be completed, completed partially, incorrectly completed, or substantially delayed. MyHeroWallet is not responsible for any loss incurred by you caused in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by a Hard Fork or other network disruption. MyHeroWallet may at its discretion support the New Currency and discontinue its support of the legacy Digital Asset. In such an event, the User is advised to withdraw the applicable Digital Assets from his User Account(s) prior to the date of the Hard Fork. MyHeroWallet is not obligated in any way to monitor or maintain balances of New Currency issued to holders of the applicable Digital Assets upon a Hard Fork, or to credit Users for the value of such New Currency. In the event a User wishes to receive New Currency issued upon a Hard Fork, the User is advised to withdraw the applicable Digital Assets from his User Account(s) prior to the date of the Hard Fork. All determinations regarding Hard Forks shall be made by MyHeroWallet in its sole and absolute discretion and in accordance with Applicable Laws.</p>

<p>We are not liable to you for errors that may result in a financial loss to you. We may take any action that is authorized or permitted by these Terms or applicable laws without liability to you, even if such action causes you to incur fees, expenses, or damages. If third parties make claims on your MyHeroWallet Account, or if we receive conflicting instructions from you, or if we become involved in or concerned about a dispute between you and any third party, we reserve the right to react in ways that we believe in good faith to be appropriate, including by closing, suspending or freezing your MyHeroWallet Account, delivering the Digital Assets available therein to you or to any third party, or interpleading assets to the court, all as we reasonably deem appropriate under the circumstances.</p>
<p>You are liable for all expenses and fees we incur for such conflicts or disputes, including internal costs and attorneys’ fees, and we may charge or deduct them directly from your MyHeroWallet Account balance.</p>

By initiating any transfer or using MyHeroWallet’s Services in any way, you attest that you are transacting in an Eligible Digital Asset which conforms to the particular Virtual Wallet into which assets are directed. For example, if you select an Ethereum Virtual Wallet Address to receive assets, you shall be solely responsible to assure that you are initiating a transfer of Ethereum alone, and not any other currency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum Classic. MyHeroWallet incurs no obligation whatsoever with regard to non- Eligible Digital Assets sent to MyHeroWallet, or for Eligible Digital Assets sent to an incompatible Virtual Wallet Address. Erroneously transmitted assets will be lost. We recommend users send a small amount of Digital Asset as a test prior to initiating a transfer of a significant amount of Digital Assets.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to limit access to your MyHeroWallet Account, which can include temporarily or permanently removing your MyHeroWallet Account access via the internet, and/or restricting your MyHeroWallet Account, and/or closing your MyHeroWallet Account without prior notice to you (unless prior notice is required by law), and we shall have no liability for such actions.
