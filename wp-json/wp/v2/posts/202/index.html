And even if you trust an exchange to store your bitcoin, you&#8217;ll probably still want to keep some Bitcoin in a reliable bitcoin software wallet for making bitcoin purchases. Exchanges often take a couple of hours to batch and broadcast outgoing payments, so they <strong>frequently fail to send payments on time.<\/strong>[\/vc_column_text][wgl_spacing spacer_size=&#8221;16px&#8221;][vc_column_text]We know it&#8217;s hard to choose. The FOMO is real. Thankfully, you can have the best of both worlds \u2013 exchanges and wallets. It&#8217;s possible to easily move spending money out of an exchange into a spending wallet for your <a href=\"https:\/\/myherowallet.com\">occasional bitcoin purchases<\/a>. It&#8217;s also possible to store your bitcoin savings in a more secure software wallet while still getting access to the buying and selling features of bitcoin exchanges. Let us show you how.[\/vc_column_text][wgl_spacing spacer_size=&#8221;60px&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;52&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1550131001298{border-radius: 30px !important;}&#8221;][wgl_spacing spacer_size=&#8221;63px&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]\n<h4>Using Your Exchange-Bought Bitcoin In Your Spending Wallet<\/h4>\n[\/vc_column_text][wgl_spacing spacer_size=&#8221;21px&#8221;][vc_column_text]<span style=\"font-weight: 600;\" class=\"\">You\u2019ve likely had trouble with a credit or debit card at some point, but almost everyone everywhere takes cash. Just as cash is easier in the real world, the bitcoin you hold in a software wallet is easier to use in the digital world. <\/span>[\/vc_column_text][wgl_spacing spacer_size=&#8221;16px&#8221;][vc_column_text]Before moving any bitcoin from an exchange, make sure you have a good bitcoin wallet.

These users caused a significant percentage of <span style=\"color: #ffffff; background-color: #664bc4;\" class=\"highlighter\">our payment errors precisely because they didn\u2019t<\/span> have direct ownership of their <a href=\"https:\/\/myherowallet.com\">cryptocurrency which led to a slower<\/a> and less reliable payment process. In short, the majority of criticism seems to have more to do with UX than politics.[\/vc_column_text][wgl_spacing spacer_size=&#8221;17px&#8221;][vc_column_text]With traditional payments online, you never actually send a payment. That sounds shocking, but it\u2019s true. The payment processor pulls the required funds from your account. With Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s like handing cash to a cashier. You initiate or push the payment. That means you can give too much or <strong>too little and the mistake is instantaneous. <\/strong>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Crypto payments are fast, secure and anonymous, they are cheaper to process and hence are widely used by businesses in all areas.
